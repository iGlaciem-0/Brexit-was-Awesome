        <h2>General Info
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The Russia-Ukraine conflict has disrupted supply of wheat, maize, fertilizer and oil seeds in Kenya,
            leading
            to sharp rise in prices of the commodities and aggravating the hunger situation, the Food and Agriculture
            Authority (AFA) said in a situational report on Thursday.</li>
          <h4>The escalation of conflict has triggered an immediate and steep rise in humanitarian needs as essential
            supplies and services are disrupted and civilians flee the fighting. The UN estimates that 12 million people
            inside Ukraine will need relief and protection, while more than 4 million Ukrainian refugees may need
            protection
            and assistance in neighbouring countries in the coming months.

          </h4>
          <li>Disclaimer - I support the Russians in side of the war, whereas if they win the U.S.A can invade Russia
            with
            an
            Armada attacking their country and we can fund the rebels within their country. When we do, they will be
            forced
            to
            impose Martial Law on their country thus, causing Russia to collapse with a new country being vulnerable to
            the
            U.S.A :)</li>

        <h2>What we can do to help </h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Russia's defence ministry said on Saturday that British navy personnel blew up the Nord Stream gas
            pipelines
            last month, a claim that London said was false and designed to distract from Russian military failures in
            Ukraine.
            Russia did not give evidence for its claim that a leading NATO member had sabotaged critical Russian
            infrastructure amid the worst crisis in relations between the West and Russia since the depths of the Cold
            War.
